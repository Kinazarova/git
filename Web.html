				<td width="30%" height="30%"> <em>The BMW M3 is a high-performance version of the BMW 3-Series, developed by BMW's in-house motorsport division, BMW M. M3 models have been derived from the E30, E36, E46, E90/E92/E93, and F80 3-series, and sold with coupe, saloon and convertible body styles. Upgrades over the "standard" 3-Series automobiles include more powerful and responsive engines, improved handling/suspension/braking systems, aerodynamic body enhancements, and interior/exterior accents with the tri-colour "M" emblem. The last M3 coupe was produced in Germany on 5 July 2013, replaced by the M4 Coupe starting with the 2015 model year, but the M3 name will remain in use for the saloon version.</em></td>
